- 👋 Hi, I’m @spiritpigeon, a name generator suggested this name, ironically I have a huge bird phobia so this seemed appropriate
- 👀 I’m interested in offering better career opportunities to IT people, especially for those from non Eu countries that are willing to move to EU, but ofcourse everyone with the right skillset can be a good candidate!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html/css, because being an IT recruiter takes only 23 hours of my day, I still have that 1 hour I need to fill out!
- 💞️ I’m looking for interesting developers interested in working in Germany's big tech companies. Mostly with PHP, Java, Python and other technologies aswell!
- 📫 How to reach me spiritpigeon42@gmail.com, please don't send actuall birds with letters.
